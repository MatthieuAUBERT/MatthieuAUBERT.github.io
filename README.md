## Who am I ?

I'm **AUBERT Matthieu**, a Game Design student at [ESMA Rennes](https://www.esma-artistique.com/campus/rennes/) in France. During my 2nd year, I started developping a passion for VFX. Since that moment, I used (and still using) to learn everything I can take to reach a level I can be proud of. I'm currently working to become a Tech Artist or a FX Artist. 

I have a great experience on **Shader and VFX Graph (Unity)**, can use **Niagara (Unreal)** with intermediate skills, have the basis on **Houdini** (and still learning for more) and my favorite one : **PopCornFX**, which one I use entirely for my 3rd year project.

I have good skills in **making real-time effects that uses particles**. I am **very creative**, I like to imagine an effect on paper then trying to replicate with all the tools I have. I'm also **concerned and careful about the comprehension of an effect in a game**. For me, FX are one of the most important part of a game because it gaves life and satisfaction but you can't do whatever you want or this will incorrectly impact the feelings and the progression of the player.

I have skills in **3D modeling** that are really useful. I can produce fast a lot of simple to intermediate meshes on **Blender** or **3DS Max** and can basically animate them. I also can produce simple textures on **Photoshop** for meshes and particles. I'm working to improve my production of flipbook textures. 

I have a **good overview on all the game developping pipeline**. I like to **socialize and learn from other people**, not only the ones that can teach me something for my skills.
