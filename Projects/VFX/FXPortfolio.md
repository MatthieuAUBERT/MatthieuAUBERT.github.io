# My Portfolio

> The effects contained here are from my personal works. Under every effect, you can read a little explanation on how it was realized. There's also other effects that are waiting to be seen in the game "Glitch" I've produced for my last year project. You can find it in the [School Project](https://github.com/MatthieuAUBERT/MatthieuAUBERT.github.io/blob/main/Projects/SchoolProjects/Projects.md) Page.

## My Works

### Basis (or first effects that needed inspirations / researches)

### Advanced (Done by my own with acquired knowledges, sometimes inspirations)

### Scenes (Works that are not only effects. Great artistic exercises)
