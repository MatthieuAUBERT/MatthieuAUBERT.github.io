## Quick Pitch

Glitch is a Tower Defense and Stealth game on PC where the player embodies a character to the 3rd person view. That character evolves within a medieval world corrupted by a strange void.
Fighting this corruption generates singularities in the whole world.

Players will have to progress quietly inside the void world to identify key structures and capture them to bring back the world as it was. When the player finds his exploration is enough, he shall survive from multiple enemies incomming by creating his own defenses.

## My Works

At first, I made a lot of researches with my art director and our 3D artist to understand how can we bring this universe to life.The whole universe is between a medieval and a virtual world. That opens some opportunities of development but closes others.
It was pretty hard to start working from no visual. Collecting concept arts, suggesting ideas or even doing some tests like on how a particle reacts with a given node took some time but it was really helpful since I gained the time lost for the development part.

I also started using PopCornFX, a FX-Software, which have a great implementation pipeline with Unreal. Of course I had to learn few things with this soft (I'm thankful to the PopCorn's Staff that helped me) but for the development phase, I was totally ready.

What's important in making FX for this kind of game is to know the limit beyond Satisfaction and Comprehension. The dev phase was greatly around that. When I started developping an idea, I must keep in mind : Is it comprehensive ? What informations does it brings to the player ? And surely, is it optimal ?

Understanding all of that AND corresponding to the art direction was the challenge. I worked on creating particles effects that corresponds to the Towers, the Traps, the Environment of the world, the player's action and his avatar, enemies responses...

What was "simple" was having the validation of my art director. We have a heavily stylized game that I understand pretty fast. 

Here's some effects I developed :




## What I Learned

This project sure gave me the full comprehension of creating an effect from scratch. I learned some skills that will be usefull in the future such as tools versatility, thinking about others jobs by implementing variables to quickly change an effect and knowledges about Vector Fields (used a little) and PopCornFX's soft (used at 90% for effects) . That also gaves me the tools to understand how hard video game productions can be I'm happy that I worked in a healthy and efficient group, with people I didn't knew that much.
