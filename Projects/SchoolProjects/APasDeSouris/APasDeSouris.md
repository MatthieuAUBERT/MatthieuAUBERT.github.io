## Quick Pitch

This project aims to introduce young people aged 8 to 10 to the Parliament of Brittany via a mobile game.

In this small mobile investigation game, you will participate in the investigation of a mysterious theft in Parliament. You will have to navigate within the building to interrogate the various suspects and recover as many clues as possible. But your suspects aren't just anyone... Welcome to a little world of mice!
