## Quick Pitch

This project aims to introduce young people aged 8 to 10 to the Parliament of Brittany via a mobile game.

In this small mobile investigation game, you will participate in the investigation of a mysterious theft in Parliament. You will have to navigate within the building to interrogate the various suspects and recover as many clues as possible. But your suspects aren't just anyone... Welcome to a little world of mice!

## My Works

As a Tech Artist and a Programmer, I had to create the whole code and, with some additionnal tools, implement the assets correctly and nicely.

I started to search for some tools that will help me to create a story displayed like a Visual Novel. That was one of our key feature that we wanted to make, as it will tell the story of our game and give informations about the Parliament. We really had the idea to keep the game as an innovative and funny guide that will make kids following their own tour. So we had the help of a tool called Ink, that had an entire integration with Unity, we just need to learn some syntaxes. It was quite useful as it took us a very short time to learn and use and allowed us to quickly import our texts.

After that, with the Game Designer, we tried to make an interesting investigation with a Cluedo-like game. I had to create a few scripts that can manage clues, UI, texts and assets. We had to keep in mind that the game was for young children and that was not an easy part. 

With my artist, we created all the assets. As he is really good in 3D and UI, I let him with that and create the little characters in 2D by my side which was quite fun.

We really wanted to implement a system where the player could move from one room to another by scanning a QR code directly on each room of the Parliament, but we didn't get the time nor the possibility to continue our partnership with the Parliament.

## What I Learned

That project really improved my programming skills especially on Unity / C# but it learned me as well that I didn't want to became a Programmer. Fortunately, doing the Tech Artist job really interested me and I love working with a lot of tools. That was also our first teamwork and that learned us to manage not only ourselves but also the others.
