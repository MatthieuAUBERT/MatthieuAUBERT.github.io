## Quick Pitch

The player embodies a school janitor. He is an old person who begins to sink into madness, has memory problems, and hears, one night, strange noises in the building. 
After a moment, he then wakes up, in a police station, handcuffed in front of an inspector who is very aggressive and accuses him of the murder of four students. It will be necessary to trace back the history of this terrible night.

## My Works

As a Narrative Designer I had to produce a lot of texts (which I will not provide for time reason). I worked many hours to produce even one version of a good scenario.
It took me 1 month, 5 versions of a synopsis, 3 of a scenario, a precise script and a whole narrative design document which was the reference document of the team to "complete" my work.
During all of this work, I really tried to understand what people loved in Thriller stories. I did a lot of researches, studies a lot of articles and documents, just to get close to a good thrilling story.
I think this last point is really important to do in some jobs like Narrative Design, Tech Artist, Game Designers and so on.

I worked with Word to write texts and tried to beautify the presentation as much as possible, used Excel to quickly reference events, dialogues and sounds to ease implementing (which programmers and I were assuming) and took in charge the project management soft (HackNPlan) and all other design documents.
Sometimes, I helped the Level Design to really get the environment close to the narration without being boring or too complex for the player.

After that, my job was to take of everything that was not ready or done. First, there was animation and cinematics, things our whole team greatly underestimated. That costs us a lot time and gaves a poor look to our game.
Even if this was a disappointment, we get close to a little result and learned a lot. Animations was done with 3DS Max and Cinematics with Unreal Cine Camera.

There was a little time to start adding some effects and learn Niagara, what I did with pleasure because it was the time I discovered my passion for FX.

## What I Learned

Even if we're not happy with the visual results, that project probably learned me the most with [Glitch](https://github.com/MatthieuAUBERT/MatthieuAUBERT.github.io/blob/main/Projects/SchoolProjects/Glitch/Glitch.md).
I learned to accept failures and taking care of not reproducing mistakes. It seems pretty easy/usual said like that but that only comes when you faces that kind of issues that you understand a lot.
There was also great points such as the code (our devs created a good AI), the story (and narrative ideas) and the Game Design (with good mechanics that were between a horrific HideNSeek game and Narrative Adventure)
That was also the time I started to develop my skills that leads me where I am today, a future Tech/VFX artist.
I really liked being a Narrative Designer because I enjoy creating stories and developing universes and those skills will help me to add layers on my effects to bring emotions and sensations to players.
