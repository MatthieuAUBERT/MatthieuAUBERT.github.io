## Quick Pitch

You play as a young woman who must escape her nightmares, in a unique platformer that comes in three original levels.

The world of dreams is no longer the welcoming place you think! It's up to you to face it with your new powers such as the creation of platforms or the possibility of making you insensitive. But nightmares won't pass you by so easily! They are also a real danger! You will have to do everything to dodge them because you have no way to destroy them.

A tragic universe, mixing the retro spirit and obscure themes that will appeal to some people.

## My Works

For this game, I did everything except the sound (which was made by a friend of mine).

That was my first game done by my own which was really fun and instructive. From art to code and game design, I create everything and did a lot of research to make the game as best as possible.

Here's some screenshots of the game :

## What I Learned

There's a lot of things that don't work or just needed to be added. But time played against me and I couldn't fix every bug, add effects, polish the art or fix mechanics. It was a great challenge that taught me to have a good autonomy as well as a great organization and improved all of my skills.
