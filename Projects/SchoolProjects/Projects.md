## Glitch

> Glitch is a **Tower Defense and Stealth** game developed with **Unreal Engine 4.27** in **2022-2023**.

My last-year project of the ESMA's Game Design formation where I could freely develop my passion and my skills for FX. During this project, I mainly was a Tech/VFX Artist but did other few things like Animation and UI. I mainly use PopCornFX to work but also Niagara, Unreal Materials and FluidNinja (this one gave me the opportunity to discover VectorFields).

## Tell Me What You Saw

> Tell Me What You Saw is a **Thriller Action-Adventure** game developed with **Unreal Engine 4** during  2 months in **2022**.

As a Narrative Designer for this project, I really enjoyed developing a whole story/universe which gaves me another perspective of the game development and will probably help me a lot to create new effects giving great sensations. Even if tis project is really not finished visually, my group and I did a great job to produce a thrilling story.

## À Pas de Souris

> À Pas de Souris (With Little Mouse Steps) is a **Puzzle** game developed with **Unity 2021** during 1 month in **2021**.

This game was produced to answer our first collaboration between the school and an external "customer" (which was the Parlement of Brittany). In a group of 3, I was in the Technical Pole, where I had to do the coding, implementing, quick level design, tools managing, some 2D and UI and be a true Tech Artist. Like the previous project, this one needed a few more time to be visually nice and technically more developed but came to be a quick and fun game.

## Dreamnia

> Dreamnia : Open Your Eyes is a **Platformer** game developed with **Phaser 3** during 2 months of **2021**.

With this first year project, it was our first real challenge. This project was individual, we had to make everything by our own. The code, the game design, the narrative design and the art were all created by myself, which was pretty fun and satisfying when the final result came. Even with some bugs and Art Direction inconsistencies, this game is my first one developed by my own.
