# My Interests

If you want to know me better, it's good to know what I like !

## Videos Games (My Top 5 + My Most Played)

### Nier: Automata, or the weird universe of Taro Yoko that makes me want to develop games.


&nbsp;

### The Legend Of Zelda : Breath Of the Wild (and the whole Zelda Serie), or the games I'll buy Day-1 every time.


&nbsp;

### Persona 5 Royal, the game that surprises me as much as Maruki's betrayal.


&nbsp;

### Bravely Default Serie, the game that deserves FAR more popularity


&nbsp;

### Pokemon Serie, because training those Fairy types to give headaches to strategic strong Over Used Dragon-type Spammers is the best feeling.


&nbsp;

### League Of Legends, my most played game and probably the VFX-Style I want to achieve as well as the 5 before.
