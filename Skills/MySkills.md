# My Skills

> If you to collaborate with me, it's better to know what I can do and what I can bring to your works.

## A great tools mastery

> In addition of my 3-year Game Design formation, I taught myself a lot of tools that are commonly used in a video game creation pipeline. Game Engines first came as a priority to learn to understand how it works and to be capable of manipulating any engine.

### From Unity to Unreal, and a few more...

During my first year, at ESMA, we didn't use engines like Unity or Unreal. Developing games was introduced by using a HTML Framework named Phaser 3. This was a great start because there was neither visual interface nor features that can be found in game engines. But it learned us to search by our own and greatly develop our knowledges on coding.
Using that framework allowed me to understand and code better on tools like Visual Studio, Notepad ++, and so on.

After, we were introduced to game engines. First came Unity which was a nice discovery, as it's now my favorite engine to develop on. I continue to learn and develop coding, starting to mastering something (without being at the level of programmers). I easily understood the interface and tools that were available. But the interesting part came by developing my passion for FX and particles. By discovering this passion that I want to be my work, I wanted to master FX Tools as much as possible. On Unity, I learned Shuriken, VFX Graph, Shader Graph, HLSL language and Animator to create VFX and strengthen skills I need. Now, I know this tools with comfort and have the desire to continue using and learning this kind of tools, which PopcornFX gave me the opportunity to but we'll see that later.

For Unreal, it's a long story. It began with my second year last project. We started to learn the engine pretty late and as a Narrative Designer for this project I didn't use a lot the engine. So I had to recover the late everytime I could. I first discover Niagara, Cascade and Unreal Materials. It was visually quite different from Unity but what's behind was the same. By doing that, I was not lost when I joined the team I had for the Glitch project (Last Year Project that I invite you to discover at this [page](https://github.com/MatthieuAUBERT/MatthieuAUBERT.github.io/blob/main/Projects/SchoolProjects/Glitch/Glitch.md)). They choose Unreal Engine as their main game development tool. I also had to learn Blueprints and got the basis since.

For personal purpose, I also did some researches on some engines like Godot and Open 3D Engine but didn't use them.

Today, I know that I can get pretty quick to use a new engine, thanks to Unity and Unreal. I'm pretty comfortable in learning new tools and discovering how far we can go with these.

> Learning some engines is not enough, especially if I wanted to become VFX/Tech Artist. I'm qualified at using extern softwares needed in game creation.

### 2D or 3D, I'll do with both.
